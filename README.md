You can also join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sTgnUxC3ms) if you want to ask me about how to qib _(or anything about my work basically)_!

### v2.0.0 checklist
Move to the [PR](https://github.com/SuperNeon4ik/NoxesiumUtils/pull/19)

### What is Noxesium and why does it need Utils?
[Noxesium Mod](https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium) _(by Noxcrew)_ is a fabric mod with feature additions, bugfixes, and performance improvements. 
It allows servers to offer a better experience to clients through access to additional features beyond vanilla limitations. 
However, servers need to have a plugin to communicate with the mod to actually be able to use it's features, and that's where **NoxesiumUtils** comes in. 
It allows server owners to easily communicate with the mod via commands and can also be used as a dependency for plugin developers.

### Features
- Send server rules on join
- Send server rules to players with commands
- Check player's client settings.
- There is a little more to it, lol.
- Maybe more soon 🤔

### Requirements
- Paper 1.20+
- [CommandAPI](https://modrinth.com/plugin/commandapi)
- _The plugin won't do anything to players without the mod_

### Commands
**Send Server Rule.** Sends a server rule to a selection of players.

#### Set server rule for players
```
/noxesiumutils serverrule <rule> <players: selector> <value>
/noxesiumutils serverrule <rule> <players: selector> reset
```

#### Set entity rule for entities
```
/noxesiumutils entityrule <rule> <entities: selector> <value>
/noxesiumutils entityrule <rule> <entities: selector> reset
```

#### Check player's Noxesium Protocol Version.
```
/noxesiumutils check <player: player>
/noxesiumutils check <players: selector>
```
#### Check player's settings.
```
/noxesiumutils clientSettings <player: player>
```

For more detailed information on how everything here works, please refer to the [Noxesium Mod README](https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium/#readme)!

### Config
The default config looks like this. 
Right now it only contains a setting to send server rules to a player on join.
```yaml
# View Protocol documentation and information about the mod here:
# https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium

# Add some extra output for debugging purposes
extraDebugOutput: false

# If true will check the plugin's version once in a while.
checkForUpdates: true

# It true will send defaults to Noxesium Players on join.
sendDefaultsOnJoin: false

# Comment out the line if you don't want to send that rule.
defaults:
    #cameraLocked: false
    #disableBoatCollisions: false
    #disableDeferredChunkUpdates: false
    #disableMapUi: false
    #disableSpinAttackCollisions: false
    #disableUiOptimizations: false
    #disableVanillaMusic: false
    #enableSmootherClientTrident: false
    #heldItemNameOffset: 0
    #overrideGraphicsMode: FAST
    #riptideCoyoteTime: 0
    #showMapInUi: false

#qibDefinitions:
#customCreativeItems: []
```

#### On-join defaults
For example, the following changes will make the plugin automatically send
the players `disableSpinAttackCollisions = true` on join.
```yaml
sendDefaultsOnJoin: true

defaults:
    disableSpinAttackCollisions: true
```

#### Qib definitions
What are Qibs? Good question. I won't explain it perfectly, 
so please read [the comments in this file in Noxcrew/noxesium](https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium/blob/main/api/src/main/java/com/noxcrew/noxesium/api/qib/QibDefinition.java).

The `qibDefinitions` list is a place to define the definitions which are made up of QibEffects ([see list of them here](https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium/blob/main/api/src/main/java/com/noxcrew/noxesium/api/qib/QibEffect.java)).
Here's an example of a QibDefinition in the config:
```yaml
qibDefinitions: 
  ding:
    onEnter: 'play_ding'
    onLeave: 'play_ding'
    triggerEnterLeaveOnSwitch: false
```
Now scary part: **writing QibEffects**.\
Each QibEffect is saved in its own json file which is saved in `plugins/NoxesiumUtils/qibs` folder.

Example of a QibEffect which plays the ding sound (`plugins/NoxesiumUtils/qibs/play_ding.json`):
```json
{
  "type": "PlaySound",
  "effect": {
    "namespace": "minecraft",
    "path": "entity.experience_orb.pickup",
    "volume": 1.0,
    "pitch": 1.0
  }
}
```

_(probably very useful to some)_ A jumppad QibEffect example:
```json
{
  "type": "Multiple",
  "effect": {
    "effects": [
      {
        "type": "PlaySound",
        "effect": {
          "namespace": "minecraft",
          "path": "entity.experience_orb.pickup",
          "volume": 1.0,
          "pitch": 1.0
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "Wait",
        "effect": {
          "ticks": 1,
          "effect": {
            "type": "SetVelocityYawPitch",
            "effect": {
              "yaw": 0,
              "yawRelative": true,
              "pitch": -45,
              "pitchRelative": false,
              "strength": 2.0,
              "limit": 2.5
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

After making a QibEffect you use the file name of a QibEffect as an ID in a QibDefinition section (all fields are optional):
```yaml
qibDefinitions: 
  ding:
    onEnter: 'QIB_EFFECT_ID'
    onLeave: 'QIB_EFFECT_ID'
    whileInside: 'QIB_EFFECT_ID'
    onJump: 'QIB_EFFECT_ID'
    triggerEnterLeaveOnSwitch: false
```

After that you can reload the server and apply the rule to an entity:
```
/noxesiumutils entityRules qibBehavior [ENTITY] ding
```

And enable the Qib for all players:
```
/noxesiumutils serverRules qibBehaviors @a ding
```

#### Custom creative items
You cat enable a tab in the creative inventory menu for Noxesium players with
a command (`/noxesiumutils serverRules customCreativeItems @a true`).
This is the place where you define these items. Here's an example:
```yaml
customCreativeItems:
  - 'minecraft:stick[minecraft:enchantments={levels:{"minecraft:knockback":25}}]'
  - 'netherite_chestplate[trim={pattern:wild,material:emerald},custom_name=''["",{"text":"Silly name ngl","italic":false}]'',lore=[''["",{"text":"I dont !!!!!!! understand how i will implement this","italic":false}]''],enchantments={levels:{aqua_affinity:1,blast_protection:4,protection:5}},custom_model_data=2]'
```

### For Developers
**Adding NoxesiumUtils to your project**

You can easily add NoxesiumUtils to your project from the [Modrinth Maven Repository](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/tutorials/maven/)!

> [!NOTE] 
> Since NoxesiumUtils is now using [Noxesium/paper](https://github.com/Noxcrew/noxesium/tree/main/paper)
> it might actually be better for you to just implement it yourself. 
> I will attempt making NoxesiumUtils worth being a dependency in update 2.1.

```java
public class EventListener implements Listener {
    @EventHandler
    public void on(NoxesiumPlayerJoinEvent event) {
        // Received player's noxesium protocol version
        Player player = event.getPlayer();
        int protocolVersion = event.getProtocolVersion();
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void on(NoxesiumPlayerClientSettingsEvent event) {
        // Received player's client settings
        Player player = event.getPlayer();
        ClientSettings clientSettings = event.getClientSettings();
    }
}
```
